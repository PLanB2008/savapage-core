 * This object type models relevant aspects of a real-world entity such as a

 * possible attributes that may be supported by instances of that object type.
 * For each object (instance), the actual set of supported attributes and values
 * describe a specific implementation. The objectâ€™s attributes and values
 * describe its state, capabilities, realizable features, job processing
 * functions, and default behaviors and characteristics (RFC2911 - page 12).

    /*
     * All Printer and Job objects are identified by a Uniform Resource
     * Identifier (URI) [RFC2396] so that they can be persistently and
     * unambiguously referenced.
     */

    /*
     * Each attribute included in the set of attributes defining an object type
     * is labeled as:
     *
     * - "REQUIRED": each object MUST support the attribute.

     * - "OPTIONAL": each object MAY support the attribute.

     * IPP objects support operations. An operation consists of a request and a
     * response. When a client communicates with an IPP object, the client
     * issues an operation request to the URI for that object.
     *
     * Operation requests and responses have parameters that identify the
     * operation.
     *
     * Operations also have attributes that affect the run-time characteristics
     * of the operation (the intended target, localization information, etc.).
     * These operation-specific attributes are called operation attributes (as
     * compared to object attributes such as Printer object attributes or Job
     * object attributes).
     *
     * Each request carries along with it any operation attributes, object
     * attributes, and/or document data required to perform the operation.
     *
     * Each request requires a response from the object. Each response indicates
     * success or failure of the operation with a status code as a response
     * parameter. The response contains any operation attributes, object
     * attributes, and/or status messages generated during the execution of the
     * operation request.
