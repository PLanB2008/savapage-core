/**
 * This REQUIRED operation allows a client to request the values of attributes
 * of a Job object and it is almost identical to the Get-Printer-Attributes
 * operation (see section 3.2.5). The only differences are that the operation is
 * directed at a Job object rather than a Printer object, there is no
 * "document-format" operation attribute used when querying a Job object, and
 * the returned attribute group is a set of Job object attributes rather than a
 * set of Printer object attributes.
 *
 * For Jobs, the possible names of attribute groups are:
 *
 * - 'job-template': the subset of the Job Template attributes that apply to a
 * Job object (the first column of the table in Section 4.2) that the
 * implementation supports for Job objects.
 *
 * - 'job-description': the subset of the Job Description attributes specified
 * in Section 4.3 that the implementation supports for Job objects.
 *
 * - 'all': the special group 'all' that includes all attributes that the
 * implementation supports for Job objects.
 *
 * Since a client MAY request specific attributes or named groups, there is a
 * potential that there is some overlap. For example, if a client requests,
 * 'job-name' and 'job-description', the client is actually requesting the
 * "job-name" attribute once by naming it explicitly, and once by inclusion in
 * the 'job-description' group. In such cases, the Printer object NEED NOT
 * return the attribute only once in the response even if it is requested
 * multiple times. The client SHOULD NOT request the same attribute in multiple
 * ways.
 *
 * It is NOT REQUIRED that a Job object support all attributes belonging to a
 * group (since some attributes are OPTIONAL). However it is REQUIRED that each
 * Job object support all these group names.
