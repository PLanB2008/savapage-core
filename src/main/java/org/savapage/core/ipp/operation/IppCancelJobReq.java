     * Group 1: Operation Attributes
     *
     *
     * Natural Language and Character Set:
     *
     * The "attributes-charset" and "attributes-natural-language" attributes as
     * described in section 3.1.4.1.
     *
     * Target:
     *
     * Either (1) the "printer-uri" (uri) plus "job-id" (integer(1:MAX))or (2)
     * the "job-uri" (uri) operation attribute(s) which define the target for
     * this operation as described in section 3.1.5.
     *
     *
     * Requesting User Name:
     *
     * The "requesting-user-name" (name(MAX)) attribute SHOULD be supplied by
     * the client as described in section 8.3.
     *
     *
     * "message" (text(127)):
     *
     * The client OPTIONALLY supplies this attribute. The Printer object
     * OPTIONALLY supports this attribute. It is a message to the operator. This
     * "message" attribute is not the same as the "job-message-from-operator"
     * attribute. That attribute is used to report a message from the operator
     * to the end user that queries that attribute. This "message" operation
     * attribute is used to send a message from the client to the operator along
     * with the operation request. It is an implementation decision of how or
     * where to display this message to the operator (if at all).
