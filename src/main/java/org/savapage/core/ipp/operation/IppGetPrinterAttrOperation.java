/**
 * This REQUIRED operation allows a client to request the values of the
 * attributes of a Printer object. In the request, the client supplies the set
 * of Printer attribute names and/or attribute group names in which the
 * requester is interested. In the response, the Printer object returns a
 * corresponding attribute set with the appropriate attribute values filled in.
 *
 * <p>
 * For Printer objects, the possible names of attribute groups are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>'job-template': the subset of the Job Template attributes that apply to a
 * Printer object (the last two columns of the table in Section 4.2) that the
 * implementation supports for Printer objects.</li>
 *
 * <li>'printer-description': the subset of the attributes specified in Section
 * 4.4 that the implementation supports for Printer objects.</li>
 *
 * <li>'all': the special group 'all' that includes all attributes that the
 * implementation supports for Printer objects.</li>
